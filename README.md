### The Problem 
Law is an area where knowdelge is power. Understanding the intricacies and nuances of many of the processes in law can take years of study. However once understood some processes can become just a matter of copy and paste. Because of the time required to understand the process and often the risk associated with the process it will be reflected in the cost of handling the process, even if the process once understood is simple. 
A good example of a standard process is property conveyencing. 
* First an agreement is drawn up which parties agree upon. 
* Then the titles are exchanged and the data updated.

The io.property.agreement.network looks at the possibility of solving the first point. 

### Solutions for coming to an agreement
A solution that encapusalted the full transaction of poperty conveyance is outside the scope of this project as it will require co-operation with the government in the country in which the conveyance is taking place.

Some possible solutions to the completing the agreement process are listed below 
* Continue with parties going to their local lawyers to draw up an agreement. 
* A full stack application that allows partys to come to an agreement.
* A distributed ledger available via an application that tracks the steps take to reach an agreement.

### Proposed Solution Distributed ledger / Application for property agreement (Blockchain)
IBM states that blockchain can enable enterprises to :
* Free up capital
* Lower transcation costs
* Speed processes
* Provide security and trust

What if we were able to provide this distruptive technology to the area of law and effectivly provide a fast process for parties to come to an agreement with a lower cost in a way that was secure and trusted.
For this hack we have used hyperledger composer. The following details the files and the method of deployment for implementing this solution.
